# Voice ATC for GeoFS online

This adds a Voice-ATC utility to GeoFS flight sim.

When in the game, press **Ctrl+Q**, enter a six-digit frequency NNN.NN, and an ATC window will open.

Keep it in the background.

Press Q when you want to talk, release when done.


# Implementation 

This uses simplewebrtc.js library for P2P connection. See our cloud php pages for more info (blah blah, it's late and I'm too lazy to comment everything. Will do that tomorrow, I promise)
